## I am a Front-END Developer from Spain, based in SÃ£o Paulo.

My focus is on all things JavaScript and Node.js. 
I am also learning ReactJS and know a fair bit of PHP and Wordpress. 
Learning new technologies and leveraging new tools is exciting!

I am currently working as a freelance developer and I am also open to remote or full-time positions. 

## Work highlights

### Blog-Connect App
In order to learn Node.js and I implemented this sort of Facebook clone which I called [Blog-Connect App](https://github.com/jorgeberen/complex_app)
For this app I used Node.js and MongoDB. It was a a complex project that amongst other things allowed me to understand:
1. How authentication works
2. How the front-end communicates with the back-end
3. How to sanitized and clean input data

### Spanish Chunks App
I have transitioned from Spanish Teacher to Front-end Developer and in this process I have started a personal project called [Spanish Chunks](spanischchunks.com)
