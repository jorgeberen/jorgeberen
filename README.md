## I am a front-end developer from Spain, based in SÃ£o Paulo.

My focus is on all things JavaScript and Node.js. 
I am also learning ReactJS and know a fair bit of PHP and Wordpress. 

I am currently working as a freelance developer and I am also open to remote or full-time positions. 

## Work highlights
